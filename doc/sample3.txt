🏆 Scoring & Muscle Gain Potential
👉 Add your points (max = 46). Then check below:

40+ pts → Elite potential: ~6–8 kg of lean muscle in 1 year (newbies could even hit 8–10 kg).

30–39 pts → Strong gainers: ~4–6 kg muscle per year.

20–29 pts → Moderate: ~2–4 kg muscle per year.

<20 pts → Slow progress: ~1–2 kg per year (focus on consistency, recovery, and nutrition).
