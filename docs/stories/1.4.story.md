# Story 1.4: Text Parsing & Survey Storage

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Creator,
**I want** to submit my formatted survey text and have the system parse and save it,
**so that** I can generate a unique shareable link for my survey.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend endpoint accepts survey text and parsing logic correctly interprets syntax
2. New survey record is created and linked to user with unique slug generated and returned
3. Survey will NOT be saved to database until user clicks "Save Survey" button
4. Live preview operates same way as real survey: shows one question at a time with single choice options
5. At end of preview survey, user gets total score and description based on score
6. "Save Survey" button saves the parsed survey to database

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source Documents:**
- [Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
- [Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
- [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#functional]
- [Source: doc/sample.txt] - Reference format for text parsing
- [Source: doc/frontend-prompt.md] - UI styling and design specifications

### Text Format Specification
Based on the sample.txt reference format, the parser must handle:
- **Survey Title**: First line of text becomes the survey title
- **Survey Description**: Paragraph after title before questions
- **Questions**: Numbered format (1., 2., etc.)
- **Answer Options**: Lettered format (a), b), c), d) with descriptive text
- **Scoring Guide**: Special section with point values and score ranges
- **Recommendations**: Score-based feedback sections

### Parsing Requirements
The text parsing engine must extract:
1. Survey metadata (title, description)
2. Question text and numbering
3. Answer options with labels and text
4. Scoring system (a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 pattern)
5. Score ranges and corresponding recommendations
6. Validation notes or disclaimers

### Technical Implementation Context
**Current Backend Structure:**
- use deepseek api to parse the survey
- NestJS API with SurveysService at `apps/api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts`
- Existing CRUD operations and slug generation
- CreateSurveyDto at `apps/api/src/surveys/dto/create-survey.dto.ts`
- Prisma database integration with Survey model

**Required Changes:**
- Add text parsing utility in `apps/api/src/surveys/utils/text-parser.ts`
- Create new parse-only endpoint `/api/surveys/parse` that returns parsed structure without saving
- Keep existing `/api/surveys` POST endpoint for final database save
- Add DTO for parse request and response
- Store parsed structure in frontend state until user saves

**Two-Phase Approach:**
1. **Parse Phase**: Text → Parsed Structure + Slug (no database save)
2. **Save Phase**: User clicks save → Database storage using existing endpoint

### Database Integration
The existing Survey model in Prisma schema includes:
- `content` field (JSON) for storing parsed survey structure
- `title` and `description` fields extracted from parsed text
- `slug` generation already implemented
- User association via `userId` field

### Frontend Integration Points
**Current Survey Creation UI:**
- Text area component at `apps/web/src/app/create/page.tsx`
- File upload functionality for .txt files
- Live preview component that will need parsed data
- Generate Link button that calls surveys API

**Required Updates:**
- Call parse API when text changes to get structured data
- Store parsed survey in component state (not database)
- Replace static preview with interactive survey preview
- Show one question at a time with radio button options
- Calculate and display score at end of preview
- Add "Save Survey" button that calls existing save API
- Only generate shareable link after survey is saved to database
- Follow doc/frontend-prompt.md for all UI styling (colors, typography, spacing)

### Error Handling Requirements
The parsing system must handle:
- Missing survey title or questions
- Malformed question numbering
- Invalid answer option format
- Missing or invalid scoring guide
- Empty or whitespace-only content
- Excessively long content (file size limits)

### UI Design Requirements
**Frontend Styling Reference:**
All new UI components must follow the specifications in doc/frontend-prompt.md including:
- **Color Palette**: Primary #2B6CB0, Secondary #4A5568, Background #F7FAFC
- **Typography**: Inter font family, specific size scales (H1: 32px, H2: 24px, Body: 16px)
- **Spacing**: 8-point grid system for consistent spacing
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states, focus indicators, accessible form controls
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints

**Interactive Survey Preview Styling:**
- Question cards with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Radio button styling matching design system
- Progress indicators for question navigation
- Score display with appropriate visual emphasis
- Clear "Save Survey" button styling

### Testing Strategy
**Unit Testing:**
- Text parser utility with various valid formats
- Error cases for malformed text
- Edge cases (empty sections, special characters)
- Interactive preview component functionality
- Score calculation accuracy

**Integration Testing:**
- Full API flow with text input
- Frontend form submission with parsing
- Error response handling in UI
- Complete survey preview workflow
- Styling compliance with frontend-prompt.md

**Test Files Location:**
- Parser tests: `apps/api/src/surveys/utils/__tests__/text-parser.spec.ts`
- Service tests: Update existing `apps/api/src/surveys/__tests__/surveys.service.spec.ts`
- Frontend tests: `apps/web/src/app/create/__tests__/create-page.spec.tsx`
- Preview component tests: `apps/web/src/components/survey/__tests__/InteractiveSurveyPreview.spec.tsx`

### Performance Considerations
- Text parsing should be efficient for files up to 1MB
- Parsed survey structure stored as optimized JSON
- Consider caching parsed results for preview functionality
- Validate text size before processing to prevent timeout

- Responsive design following the specified design system

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/api/src/surveys/__tests__/surveys.service.spec.ts`
- **Change**: Fixed test assertion to expect JSON stringified content
- **Why**: Test was failing because service JSON.stringify() content before storage but test expected raw string
- **How**: Updated test expectation to match actual service behavior, ensuring test accuracy

**File**: `apps/api/src/surveys/utils/text-parser.ts`
- **Change**: Enhanced error handling with more detailed logging and better error messages
- **Why**: Original error handling was too generic and didn't provide enough debugging information
- **How**: Added structured error logging with HTTP status codes and clearer user-facing error messages

**File**: `apps/web/src/components/survey/InteractiveSurveyPreview.tsx`
- **Change**: Optimized performance with useMemo for score calculations
