## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source Documents:**
- [Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
- [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#functional]
- [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#core-screens-and-views]

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion:
- Survey creation and storage infrastructure is fully implemented
- Survey slugs are generated and stored in database
- Authentication and user association is working correctly
- API endpoints for survey CRUD operations are available

### Current Implementation Status
**PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS**: The dashboard functionality (AC 1-3) has been implemented, but the public survey page (AC 4-6) still needs to be created. Current implementation includes:

### Data Models
**Survey Model** (from previous stories):
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `userId`: User association for filtering
- `title`: Survey title for display
- `description`: Optional description for dashboard
- `slug`: Unique slug for URL generation
- `createdAt`: Creation timestamp for sorting
- `isActive`: Status flag for controlling access
[Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### API Specifications
**Dashboard API Integration**:
- GET `/api/surveys` - Fetches user's surveys (implemented as proxy to backend)
- Backend endpoint: `PublicSurveysController.getAllSurveysPublic()` 
- Returns array of survey objects with all necessary fields
- Authentication handled via session/auth guard
[Source: Previous story implementation - Story 1.4]

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Page Component**: `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- AuthGuard wrapper for authentication protection
- State management for surveys list, loading, and error states
- useEffect hook for data fetching on component mount
- Responsive design with Chakra UI components
- User feedback for copy operations and error handling
[Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#overall-ux-vision]

### File Locations
**Frontend Files** (dashboard - already implemented):
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard component
- `apps/web/src/app/api/surveys/route.ts` - API proxy for survey fetching
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication hook
- `apps/web/src/components/AuthGuard.tsx` - Authentication wrapper

**Frontend Files** (public survey page - TO BE CREATED):
- `apps/web/src/app/survey/[slug]/page.tsx` - Public survey display page (no auth required)
- `apps/web/src/app/survey/[slug]/not-found.tsx` - 404 page for invalid slugs
- Reuse existing: `apps/web/src/components/survey/InteractiveSurveyPreview.tsx`

**Backend Integration** (from Story 1.4):
- `apps/api/src/surveys/surveys.controller.ts` - PublicSurveysController with findBySlug endpoint
- `apps/api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts` - findOneBySlug service method

### Design System Integration
**UI Implementation**:
- Chakra UI v3 components for consistent styling
- Color scheme: Primary #2B6CB0, Background #F7FAFC
- Typography: Inter font family
- Responsive grid layout with proper spacing
- Loading states with spinner component
- Error handling with visual feedback
[Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#branding]

### URL Generation Strategy
**Shareable Link Format**:
- Pattern: `${window.location.origin}/survey/${survey.slug}`
- Uses browser's current origin for proper domain
- Survey slug provides unique, user-friendly URLs
- Links open survey in new tab for testing
[Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]

### Testing Requirements
**Component Testing Strategy**:
- Test survey list rendering with mock data
- Test loading and error states
- Test copy link functionality with clipboard API
- Test responsive design across breakpoints
- Test authentication integration
[Source: Previous story testing patterns from Story 1.4]

### Performance Considerations
- useEffect dependency optimization for data fetching
- Proper error boundary handling
- Loading state management
- Responsive design for mobile performance
[Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#non-functional]

### Public Survey Page Requirements
**Route Structure**:
- URL pattern: `/survey/[slug]` (e.g., `/survey/wellness-assessment-abc123`)
- No authentication required for public access
- Survey data fetched by slug via public API endpoint
- Handle inactive surveys with appropriate messaging
[Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#functional - FR6]

**Component Integration**:
- Reuse `InteractiveSurveyPreview.tsx` for consistent survey experience
- Parse stored survey content (JSON) into component-friendly format
- Maintain same one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern
- Show final score and recommendations at completion
[Source: Story 1.4 implementation]

**Error Handling**:
- Survey not found (invalid slug) → 404 page
- Inactive survey → "Survey not available" message
- Malformed survey data → Error boundary with fallback
- API failures → Retry mechanism with user feedback

### Security Considerations
**Dashboard (Authenticated)**:
- AuthGuard protection for authenticated access only
- User-specific survey filtering on backend
- No exposure of other users' survey data
- Secure clipboard API usage

**Public Survey Page (Unauthenticated)**:
- No authentication required for survey taking
- Only active surveys accessible via slug
- No user data exposure or admin capabilities
- Rate limiting considerations for survey completion
[Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#non-functional]

## Testing

### Test File Locations
**Frontend Tests** (to be created if not existing):
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/__tests__/page.spec.tsx` - Dashboard component tests
- Integration with existing test infrastructure from previous stories

### Test Standards
