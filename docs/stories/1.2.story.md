## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Project uses Turborepo monorepo with apps/web (Next.js), apps/api (NestJS), packages/shared
- Frontend: Next.js 15 with Chakra UI v3 configured and working
- Backend: NestJS with basic health endpoints working
- Shared package: TypeScript types and utilities with Jest testing
- All builds passing, tests running, single dev command configured

### Architecture Context
**Source Documents:**
- [Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
- [Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]
- [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#functional]

### Authentication Architecture
The system features a progressive authentication model, initially identifying users with FingerprintJS for immediate access and later prompting for a full Google account. [Source: docs/architect/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice
- **Platform:** Vercel for frontend hosting and serverless function execution. Render.com for the database.
- **Key Services:**
  - Google: OAuth 2.0 for authentication
  - Render.com: Managed PostgreSQL
- **Deployment Host and Regions:** Vercel (Global Edge Network), Render (e.g., US East)

### Functional Requirements
FR1: Users must be able to create an account and log in using their Google account.
[Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#functional]

### Data Models
User interface already defined in shared package:
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: enum; // update this file
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```
[Source: packages/shared/src/types/index.ts]

### API Response Pattern
Use the established ApiResponse pattern for consistent API responses:
```typescript
export interface ApiResponse<T = any> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  message?: string;
  role?: enum //'User' or 'Admin' default is 'User' update this file
}
```
[Source: packages/shared/src/types/index.ts]

### File Locations and Project Structure
Based on established project structure:
- Frontend authentication code: `apps/web/src/`
- Backend authentication code: `apps/api/src/auth/`
- Shared authentication types: `packages/shared/src/types/`
- Database configuration: `apps/api/src/database/`

### Security Requirements
NFR2: The application must be secure, implementing standard security practices (e.g., input validation, protection against XSS/CSRF) to protect user data.
[Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#non-functional]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React-based framework (Next.js already set up)
- Must use PostgreSQL, hosted on Render.com
- Primary hosting platform will be Vercel
[Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]

### Testing Requirements
From previous story: "The project must include both Unit and Integration tests to ensure a solid foundation of quality for the MVP." Testing frameworks (Jest) are already configured in all packages.

### Testing
**Testing Standards:** Configure testing frameworks for both frontend and backend applications. Create comprehensive tests for authentication flow including OAuth integration, session management, and security validations.

**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for authentication services and components
- Integration tests for complete OAuth flow
- Security tests for token validation and session management
- Test file locations following established pattern: `src/__tests__/` in respective packages
