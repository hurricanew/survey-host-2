## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source Documents:** 
- [Source: doc/architect.md#introduction]
- [Source: doc/architect.md#high-level-architecture]

### Technical Summary
TTI will be architected as a modern, full-stack serverless application managed within a monorepo. The structure is designed for low friction, rapid development, and automatic scaling. [Source: doc/architect.md#technical-summary]

### Recommended Starter Template
It is highly recommended to use the official `create-next-app` with the TypeScript and Turborepo options. This provides a production-ready Next.js application, handles the initial TypeScript and monorepo configuration, and aligns perfectly with our Vercel hosting strategy. [Source: doc/architect.md#starter-template-or-existing-project]

### Repository Structure
- **Structure:** Monorepo
- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo (as configured by `create-next-app`)
- **Package Organization:**
  - `apps/web`: The Next.js frontend application
  - `apps/api`: The NestJS backend for API services  
  - `packages/shared`: Shared TypeScript types, validation schemas, and utilities for use by both `web` and `api`
[Source: doc/architect.md#repository-structure]

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice
- **Platform:** Vercel for frontend hosting and serverless function execution. Render.com for the database.
- **Key Services:**
  - Vercel: Next.js Hosting, Serverless Functions, Vercel Blob (for potential text file storage)
  - Render.com: Managed PostgreSQL
  - Google: OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- **Deployment Host and Regions:** Vercel (Global Edge Network), Render (e.g., US East)
[Source: doc/architect.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]

### Testing
**Testing Requirements:** The project must include both Unit and Integration tests to ensure a solid foundation of quality for the MVP. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements]

**Testing Standards:** Configure testing frameworks for both frontend and backend applications. Create basic smoke tests to verify the setup is working correctly.

### File Locations and Project Structure
Based on the architecture specification:
- Frontend code: `apps/web/`
- Backend code: `apps/api/`
- Shared utilities: `packages/shared/`
- Root configuration files for Turborepo at project root

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React-based framework to support Chakra UI [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#additional-technical-assumptions-and-requests]
- Must use PostgreSQL, hosted on Render.com [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#additional-technical-assumptions-and-requests]
- Primary hosting platform will be Vercel [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#additional-technical-assumptions-and-requests]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation.** The developer has delivered a solid, well-structured monorepo foundation that precisely meets all acceptance criteria. The code follows modern best practices, demonstrates good architectural thinking, and establishes a strong foundation for future development. The Turborepo configuration is properly set up, all three packages (web, api, shared) are correctly structured, and the CI pipeline is comprehensive.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: apps/api/src/app.controller.ts
- **Change**: Added proper TypeScript interface `HealthResponse` for health endpoint return type and included environment information
- **Why**: Improves type safety, removes any casting, and provides better operational visibility 
- **How**: Replaces loose `object` return type with strongly typed interface, adds environment context

**File**: packages/shared/src/utils/index.ts
- **Change**: Added input validation and edge case handling to `generateSlug()` and `validateEmail()` functions
- **Why**: Prevents runtime errors from invalid inputs and makes functions more robust
- **How**: Added null/undefined/type checks and string trimming for better reliability

**File**: packages/shared/src/utils/__tests__/index.test.ts
- **Change**: Added comprehensive edge case tests for utility functions
- **Why**: Ensures robustness of shared utilities with proper test coverage of edge cases
- **How**: Added tests for empty strings, whitespace, and malformed inputs

**File**: apps/api/src/__tests__/app.controller.spec.ts
- **Change**: Updated test to reflect improved health endpoint return type and removed type casting
- **Why**: Tests now properly validate the improved strongly-typed health endpoint
- **How**: Removed `as any` casting and added proper type-safe assertions

**File**: .env.example (created)
- **Change**: Added comprehensive environment variable template
- **Why**: Provides clear documentation for environment setup and future configuration needs
- **How**: Documents current and anticipated environment variables with clear comments

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent - Clean, well-structured code following TypeScript and framework best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect - Follows exact architecture specification (apps/web, apps/api, packages/shared)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Good - Basic smoke tests implemented with Jest, comprehensive edge case coverage added
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ Complete - All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced API health endpoint with proper typing and environment info
- [x] Added robust input validation to shared utilities 
- [x] Expanded test coverage for edge cases in shared package
- [x] Created comprehensive .env.example for environment documentation
- [x] Improved type safety across the API layer
- [ ] Consider adding ESLint/Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting (future story)
- [ ] Consider adding proper React Testing Library tests for frontend (future story)

### Security Review

✓ **No security concerns identified.** The implementation follows security best practices:
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- Proper CORS configuration in API
- Environment-based configuration setup
- No SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities in current code

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Performance is appropriate for scaffolding.** Key observations:
- Turborepo caching is properly configured for efficient builds
- Next.js build optimization is working (static generation enabled)
- Shared package structure enables proper code sharing and tree-shaking
- Build times are reasonable across all packages

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

This is exemplary scaffolding work. The developer has created a production-ready foundation with excellent code quality, proper testing, comprehensive CI setup, and adherence to all architectural requirements. The refactoring I performed enhances the already solid implementation with better type safety and robustness. This story is ready to be marked as "Done" and provides an excellent foundation for future development stories.
