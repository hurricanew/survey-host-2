# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be defined by speed and simplicity. For the survey creator, the interface should feel like a powerful utility that gets out of their way. For the survey respondent, the experience should be clean, intuitive, and trustworthy, ensuring a high completion rate. The design will be minimalist, prioritizing clarity and content over ornamentation.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
Creator Workflow: The primary interaction for creators will be a split-pane or toggle view: text input on one side and a live preview of the survey on the other. This provides immediate feedback and reinforces the power of the text-based workflow.

Respondent Workflow: Survey-taking will be a simple, linear, one-question-at-a-time or single-page scrollable format, optimized for mobile-first engagement.

## Core Screens and Views
The MVP will require the following conceptual screens:

Landing Page, Login Page, Dashboard, Survey Creation Page, Survey Taking Page, and Submission Confirmation Page.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

## Branding
Branding is to be determined, but the overall aesthetic should be modern, clean, and professional.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be fully responsive for all modern devices.
