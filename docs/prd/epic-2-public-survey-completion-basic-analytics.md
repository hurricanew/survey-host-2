# Epic 2: Public Survey Completion & Basic Analytics

Epic Goal: To build the public-facing survey interface, enabling response collection and storage, and integrate the foundational analytics tool.

## Story 2.1: Public Survey-Taking Interface
As a survey Respondent, I want to view a survey at its unique URL...

AC: Valid survey URL renders the survey page, questions are displayed correctly, interface is responsive, "Submit" button is visible, invalid URL shows a "Not Found" page.

## Story 2.2: Response Submission & Storage
As a survey Respondent, when I submit my answers, I want them to be securely recorded...

AC: Backend endpoint accepts submissions, FingerprintJS identifier is used, submission is validated, a new "response" record is created in the DB, duplicate submissions are discouraged, user is shown a confirmation page.

## Story 2.3: Update Dashboard with Response Count
As a Creator, I want to see the total number of responses for each of my surveys...

AC: Dashboard displays a live response count next to each survey, count updates in near real-time, count is accurate.

## Story 2.4: Basic Analytics Integration
As the Product Team, we want basic event tracking integrated...

AC: Analytics tool (e.g., PostHog) is integrated, key events (user_signup, survey_created, survey_completed, etc.) are tracked, events are associated with user IDs, no negative performance impact.
