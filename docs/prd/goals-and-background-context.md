# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
Primary Goal: To successfully launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within 3 months that validates the core hypothesis: a text-file-first workflow is a faster, more desirable method for creating online surveys for our target audience.

User Adoption: Acquire 1,000 active users within the first 6 months post-launch.

User Success: Ensure the primary user journey—creating and deploying a 10-question survey—can be completed in under 90 seconds, proving our value proposition of speed.

Business Validation: Confirm that the text-to-survey engine is the primary driver of adoption and user satisfaction.

## Background Context
Existing survey creation platforms are powerful but often slow and complex, involving cumbersome GUI builders. This creates a barrier for content creators, educators, and researchers who need to generate and deploy simple assessments quickly. Our product addresses this gap by providing a streamlined web application that instantly transforms a simple text file into a modern, shareable online survey. The core focus is on creation efficiency, a modern user experience, and a low-friction identity system to maximize engagement.
