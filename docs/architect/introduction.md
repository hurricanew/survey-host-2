# **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for TTI, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**
It is highly recommended we use the official `create-next-app` with the TypeScript and Turborepo options. This provides a production-ready Next.js application, handles the initial TypeScript and monorepo configuration, and aligns perfectly with our Vercel hosting strategy.
